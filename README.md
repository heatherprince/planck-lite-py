# plik-lite-py

A Python implementation of *Planck*'s plik-lite code (see the [*Planck* 2015 likelihood paper](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2016/10/aa26926-15/aa26926-15.html) or the [arXiv version](https://arxiv.org/abs/1507.02704)) with the option of including two approximately Gaussian low-l temperature bins to replace the temperature low-l likelihood. Currently just 2015 data, stay tuned for 2018.

[*Planck* 2015 likelihood paper](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/abs/2016/10/aa26926-15/aa26926-15.html) because the high ell plik-lite-py code is based on the public *Planck* plik-lite likelihood code and the datafiles belong to *Planck*.
